CSharpOperatorsIntro
====================

Another side-by-side tutorial I did with my sons Luke and Jake to help teach them programming

This tutorial will have 15 modules:

1)  Basic modulus logic - is a number odd or even?
2)  More advanced modulus logic. Given integer n, is it divisible by both integers p and q?
3)  Logic: Check if the nth digit (right-to-left) of integer i is digit d
4)  bitwise logic: check if the nth byte in integer i is value v (v = 0 or 1)
5)  Formulas: find the area of a trapezoid with sides x and y and height h
6)  Formulas: Find the perimeter and area of a rectangle with sides l and w
7)  Real world logic: Find the weight of a man on the moon given his weight w on Earth, if moonweight is 17% that of Earth
8)  Video Games (collision logic)! Determine if point {x, y} is within circle [{x, y} R=K]
9)  Moar gaymes! Determine if point {x, y} is within circle [{x, y} R=K] but OUTSIDE rectangle [{-1, -1}, {4, 4}]
10) Takes as input a four-digit number in format abcd (e.g. 2011) and perform the following actions:
-     Calculates the sum of the digits (2+0+1+1 = 4).
-     Prints on the console the number in reversed order: dcba (1102).
-     Puts the last digit in the first position: dabc (1201).
-     Exchanges the second and the third digits: acbd (2101).
11) Report what the value of bit in position p is of number n
12) Report if the value of bit in position p of number n is value v
13) given number n, position p, and value v, change the value of p = v and print out new n
14) determine whether number n is prime or not
15) given 32-bit unsigned int i, swap bits at position p1, p2, and p3 with 33-p1, 33-p2, and 33-p3
